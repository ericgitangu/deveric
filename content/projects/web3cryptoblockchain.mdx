# Requirements

This Dapp requires one to have a crypto wallet such as Metamask and it's suggested you use Chrome, install the Metamask extension for authentication, and to view your wallet balances, to view your transactions in detail although Metamask maintains a list of your transaction, you can use etherscan to view full details of your transactions.

This is a Coinbase clone, that bares the core functionalities of CoinBase but not all features have been implemented. Need to update the testnet for this, following the change to POS (Proof of Stake), Rinketby the testnet I was using has since been deprecated. Will be changing testnets to Goeri.
