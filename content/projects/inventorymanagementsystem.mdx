# Overview

A functional dashboard built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. It uses React Context API for state management and React Hook Form for form validation.The premise is a fully fledged inventory management system for a scaling businesses. It has a dashboard with a list of products, a form to add new products, and a form to edit existing products. It also has a search bar to search for products by name. It handles catalogues of items available, customers, inventories and serves the business with a dashboard to manage all these and users an interface to interact with the system, place orders, make payments, track invoices and orders and manage their accounts. I'm iteratively working on this project to add more features and functionality.
