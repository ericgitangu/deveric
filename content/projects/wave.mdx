An end-to-end application submission for Wave's Senior ML Engineer (LLM & Voice) position, demonstrating production-grade ML infrastructure across Rust, Python, and TypeScript.

## Architecture

The system follows a serverless event-driven design: a **Next.js 16 PWA** dashboard calls API Gateway, which routes to **Rust + PyO3 Lambda** functions. These invoke **Amazon Bedrock** (Claude 3 Haiku for sentiment analysis, Titan for embeddings) and a **SageMaker** endpoint running XLM-RoBERTa for 20-language detection. An **EventBridge** fan-out from the voice API triggers the full ML pipeline asynchronously.

## Infrastructure

Four **AWS CDK** stacks manage the backend: Submission, Voice, Bedrock, and SageMaker. Data flows through DynamoDB, S3, and SNS. SageMaker endpoints auto-stop after 59 minutes to keep costs near zero.

## Dashboard

The PWA dashboard features a submissions page with manual trigger to Wave's API, persistent history via **Upstash Redis**, real-time health probes against every backend service, dynamic OG image generation, and offline-first caching.

## CI/CD

**GitHub Actions** deploys the dashboard to **Fly.io** and the backend via CDK, then auto-submits the resume to Wave's careers API as the final pipeline step.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Rust, Python 3.12, PyO3, AWS CDK, Bedrock, SageMaker
- **Frontend**: React 19, Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion
- **Infra**: DynamoDB, S3, SNS, EventBridge, API Gateway, Upstash Redis, Fly.io
